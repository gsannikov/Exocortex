## 🧬 The Philosophy: Evolution v2.0

Biology has limits. We have a limited working memory (~7 items), limited processing speed, and limited bandwidth for input/output.
But our ambition is unlimited.

**Exocortex** is the infrastructure that bridges this gap. It is not just "productivity software" or an "AI agent."
It is a **permanent extension of your biological mind**.

### The Three Extensions
1.  **Extended Memory (The Hippocampus)**
    - **Biology**: Limited, forgetful, prone to decay.
    - **Exocortex**: Infinite, perfect recall, semantic understanding.
    - **Tech**: Local RAG + Filesystem + Vector Database.

2.  **Extended Mind (The Cortex)**
    - **Biology**: Slow, serial processing, biased.
    - **Exocortex**: Fast, parallel processing, rational.
    - **Tech**: Large Language Models (LLMs) running on your data.

3.  **Extended Agency (The Hands)**
    - **Biology**: Can only type/click at human speed.
    - **Exocortex**: Can execute thousands of actions per second.
    - **Tech**: Python Scripts + MCP Servers + API Drivers.

## ⚡ The Core Rule: Digital Sovereignty

In a world of "Agents" and "SaaS", **Exocortex stands alone**.
Most AI solutions try to *replace* the human or *rent* you intelligence.
We believe in **Augmentation**, not Replacement. And we believe in **Ownership**, not Renting.

### 1. Human-Centric, Not Agent-Centric
- Agents do things *for* you. Exocortex thinks *with* you.
- You are not the "user." You are the **Operator**.
- The goal is to make **YOU** faster, smarter, and more capable—to give you a competitive advantage that no one else has.

### 2. Radical Data Ownership
- **Your Data**: Lives on `~/exocortex-data`. On your disk.
- **Your Format**: Plain text YAML and Markdown. Readable by humans, parsable by machines.
- **Your Terms**: No cloud lock-in. No "export data" features needed—you already have the files.

### 3. Frictionless Integration
- We meet you where you are: **Apple Notes**, **Filesystem**, **Voice**.
- No new "app" to learn. Just capture thoughts naturally, and let the Exocortex process them in the background.

## 🎯 Who Is This For?

This is for the **Augmented Human**.
- The **Executive** who needs to synthesize 50 meetings a week.
- The **Engineer** who needs to recall every code snippet they've ever seen.
- The **Writer** who captures fleeting ideas and needs them connected.
- The **Strategist** who wants to simulate scenarios with an unbiased partner.

If you are content with biological limits, use a notebook.
If you want to transcend them, build your **Exocortex**.

## 🚀 The Architecture

Exocortex is brought to life through a modular **Monorepo of Skills**:

| Extension | Skill Module | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Memory** | `local-rag` | Index & Search all local documents semanticallly. |
| **Memory** | `reading-list` | Ingest, summarize, and link articles from the web. |
| **Mind** | `ideas-capture` | Expand raw thoughts into developed project plans. |
| **Mind** | `career-consultant` | Analyze market data and optimize your professional positioning. |
| **Mind** | `voice-memos` | Transcribe and extract structure from raw audio. |
| **Agency** | `social-media` | Generate and optimize external communications. |
